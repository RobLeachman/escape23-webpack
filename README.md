Escape Room '23

Every 3 years or so I get the itch to create. This time around the inventory items will
be interactable and the content much more interesting than in the previous game which was
really just a test. I got it to work but kinda hated on Unity before it was done. And forget
about monetization -- hacks upon hacks that were no fun at all.

Hopefully this year's version will be ... Less Banal
